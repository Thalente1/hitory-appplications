 app

Sarah is one of our close family friends and is an avid history buff and educator who wishes to inspire young minds. She has asked me to create an historical app where you insert a certain age, and a famous person’s figures should show up.
In my words history is something that was once used or alive in the past and now it is known for its legacy.
Edward Hallett Carr says: History is an opportunity of recording, in the way most useful to the greatest number. 
History is the study of past events, particularly in human affairs, it is usually something that has happen before. According to John Tosh (2019) he argues that history is central to an informed and critical understanding of topical issues in the present. Including a range of contemporary examples from Brexit to child sexual abuse to the impact of internet, this is an important and practical introduction for all students of history.
The purpose of history is to let the next generation know about their planet, rights, animals, culture, society, family members and friends, culture and race. It is not also about learning and reading about history it is also about making memories, honour ship, respect and leadership so that it can be remembered one day and be part of an historical event. Although some events can never be made up for example unexpected occurrences like floods, earthquakes, car accidents, titanic and many other occurrences which end being a form of a historical feature. 
According to Gustaaf Johannes Renier (Routledge, 2016), history is the accurate story which preserves the memory of the past experiences of human societies.
Anything can be part of history but for that thing to be part of history it needs to be acknowledged at least by one or two people. For something to be big and to be known there must be evidence on what was left or what was here, for example the oldest fossil that has ever been found is Toumani, the South African big 5 animals in order for the future generation to see that there are these kind of animals they must be acknowledged and kept safe.
The purpose of this historical app is to educate Sarah’s students, but not just Sarah’s students only, it is also for anyone who wishes to know about the young famous legends and old famous legends between the age of 20 years old to 45 years old that have passed away. This app takes a person’s age as an input and then matches the age to the age of different people in history when they passed away. Sarah wishes to inspire children’s mind and believes that this app will be very useful in terms of learning and making life much easier. It can also be described as a summary app because it gives you a brief on the person’s age and tells you who was that person and what did, he/she do for a living and when did he/she passed away.
I first opened the emulator when I was making the app of which the emulator is a hardware or software that enables one computer system to behave like another computer system, Then I opened my android studio started a new project on empty view activities I used kotlin language/programming language. 
Before I started adding and coding anything I first ran the app, I then opened activity main  where we normally design then app, I added a plain text where the age will be entered, added a second text view so that the about of the person could show up, as for the first text view I made it act as the heading of the app then added two buttons.
I named my edit text as search. 
The first text view as history of which is the heading. 
The second text view as brief because that’s where the info will pop up.
The first button as a clear button to clear up what is on the edit text.
And the second button as a click button/ enter button. 
I then wanted to try something different since this an historical app I added a background full of books like a library so that it could attract the students or anyone who will be using the app, it could even trick someone in such a way that they think that the app will read any book for the user.
After adding the background picture, I then went to main activity to declare everything so that it could run. I declared my buttons on set on click listener and proceeded to the tricky part. When creating an app like this we normally use an “If then else” statements that can be handled in the format of an If statement in code. I started at a minimum age of 20 years I added the age and the person’s info, of which was Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy which was known as Xxxtentacion he was an American rapper and songwriter who was murdered. I then ran the app first to check if it was working or not, luckily it worked and I had done it multiple time since the minimum of people was ten, I added twenty six. I then went back to check if am I still doing what Sarah wanted then I added an else statement for an out of range or an invalid age for example 26,4 years old of which is an invalid age, I ran the app one last time and it didn’t work. I went back to the coding/ user interface only to find out that I only missed one thing then it finally worked.
Hopefully Sarah should be able to use the app and I’m sure she will be happy about it although I was a bit late but better late and worthy than early with mistakes. 
I think this was a great idea for Sarah to think and share it because it saves a lot of time rather going to libraries and asking people, I’m sure her students and herself will love the app it even became useful to me in improving my skills of creating apps and know about some few legends that left us some where actors, singers, rappers, songwriters, actress, soundtracks and leads.
Creating this app wasn’t easy as I thought it would because I first had to ask some of my colleges for tips and ideas so that I’ll be sure that Sarah as a client is happy. Then I had to look on what I’ll be working on I used the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The requirements on what the client wants, software design how it looks like and making sure that it’s attractive, coding and implementation, testing based on the customer’s requirements to ensure the code works and check for bugs, deployment the product is delivered to the customer and finally maintenance.
Val is a constant variable and cannot assigned multiple times. Whenever we declare buttons, plain texts, text views or a spinner or any other feature in our user interface we normally use val and can be initialized only single time and is know as the immutable variable kotlin were as var is known as the mutable variable in Kotlin.
